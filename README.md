# HeapPermSwapLM
EViews Add-in for generating all possible permutations of a set of elements using Heap's algorithm.

Repository for the EViews Add-in “HeapPermSwapLM”, associated with the SoftwareX submission: “HeapPermSwapLM: Implementation of Heap’s Algorithm for Permutation Generation in EViews”.

Description:
This repository contains the EViews Add-in “HeapPermSwapLM”, which implements Heap’s algorithm for generating permutations. The Add-in is provided as a compressed “. aipz” file, which can be installed directly inside EViews. It is intended to support the experiments and analyses described in the SoftwareX article. The add-in is also downloadable from: http://www.eviews.com/Addins/heappermswaplm.aipz. 

Installation:
To install the add-in directly in EViews, simply run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. The installer is a simple EViews program that automatically takes care of the entire process of installing and registering the add-in within EViews. 

Usage:
After installation, the Add-in appears under the Add-ins menu in EViews. It is designed to be easy to use and fully integrated into the familiar EViews interface. Usage instructions and examples are provided in the “\EViews Addins\HeapPermSwapLM\ HeapPermSwapLM.pdf” file and described in the associated SoftwareX article.

Files:
The Add-in is composed by the files:
• HeapPermSwapLM.prg: the EViews program that implements the Heap’s algorithm.
• HeapPermSwapLM_install.prg: a small EViews script that automatically installs and registers the Add-in. 
• HeapPermSwapLM.pdf: a documentation file that explains the Add-in.
• LICENSE.txt: a license file that outlines the terms of use and distribution, ensuring transparency and proper licensing.
• TOC.ini: a configuration file that ensures proper integration off the Add-ins in EViews.

Requirements
• EViews version: Implemented in EViews 13 and tested in EViews 10.
• Operating System: Windows 10/11.
